series of tutorials on hibernate 
what hibernate is ?
  an orm tool --> 
  used in the data layer --> persisting to database
  implements JPA (java persistence API)
  
  what is the prob that hibernate is trying to solve? 
  lets say we have a user class with 5 fields --> id , name , address etc etc
  
  lets say we have 5 of these objects 
  1,'nish','14-15',64457158,15/5/1987
  
  we have a relational database 
  
  we need to persist these objects into the relational database 
  
  we have a user table 
  
  we save them as rows in the table 
  
  class - table
  object - row in the table 
  
  java app - we use jdbc connection 
  connect to db 
  take user object 
  and i would pull up all these fields and create sql query 
  returning ResultSet --> pull back all the individual data 
  in java we have objects --> in db level there are no objects 
  there is conversion of entitiees --> we need to use alot of boilerplate code 
  the mapping is a pain --> we need to convert each object into a sql query 
  what are the pain points?
  1.mapping member variables to columns
  2.mapping relationships is a big pain (FK etcetc)
  3.handling data types
  4.managing changes to object state
  5.relational way of doing things vs object oriented way of doing things
  6.object relational mapping - ORM 
 
how can we use it ?
